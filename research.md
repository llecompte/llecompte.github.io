## Thesis

Currently, a doctoral student in my last year, I am defending my thesis in early December 2020. I am interested in the study of structural variants in genomes, as well as long read sequencing data that are particularly useful for studying these variants. My thesis focuses on the genotyping task of the structural variants. During my PhD, I developed a new method for genotyping structural variants with long read data. I propose an implementation of this method: [SVJedi](https://github.com/llecompte/SVJedi).
