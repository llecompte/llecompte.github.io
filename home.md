## Lolita Lecompte

**Research engineer** at the Institut Curie attached to both the [bioinformatics core facility](https://institut-curie.org/plateforme/curiecoretech-bioinformatics-cubic), where I participate in the genomic and transcriptomic analysis of clinical projects, and to the [Bourc'his lab](https://institut-curie.org/team/bourchis) whose research topics focus on "epigenetic decisions and reproduction in mammals", where I am interested in approaches to detect RNA modifications from Nanopore direct RNA sequencing data, and also in the processing of Nanopore data in general.
