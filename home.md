## Lolita Lecompte
PhD Student at [Genscale team](https://team.inria.fr/genscale/)

At the end of my PhD, I am currently looking for a post-doctoral position in computational biology. I am highly interessed in studying variations in genomic data. During my thesis and my internships, I developed an expertise in genomics for the processing of sequencing data, especially for third generation sequencing data (long read data).
